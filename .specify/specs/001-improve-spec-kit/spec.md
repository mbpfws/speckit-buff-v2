## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### Cross-Platform Validation
- All requirements MUST work across all 10 supported platforms
- Requirements MUST NOT specify platform-specific implementation details
- User scenarios MUST account for different agent execution patterns
- Acceptance criteria MUST be verifiable on all platforms

### Template-Driven Consistency
- Specifications MUST follow established template structure
- Requirements MUST use standardized phrasing and formatting
- All specifications MUST be consumable by all AI agents
- Changes MUST propagate to dependent artifacts automatically

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Consider cross-platform implications**: Ensure requirements work on all 10 AI coding platforms
5. **Validate template consistency**: Follow established patterns and structure
6. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Cross-platform compatibility requirements
   - Multi-installation support considerations
   - Architecture granularity requirements
   - Agent self-regulation capabilities

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team using Spec-Kit across multiple AI coding platforms, I need the framework to address its current shortcomings so that I can efficiently develop both greenfield and brownfield projects with proper architecture guidance, cross-platform compatibility, and reliable artifact management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a brownfield project with existing codebase, **When** I initiate Spec-Kit analysis, **Then** it MUST detect project type, architecture, and historical context accurately
2. **Given** a feature development task, **When** I generate tasks, **Then** they MUST align with the actual codebase structure and maintain proper synchronization
3. **Given** cross-architecture requirements, **When** I create an implementation plan, **Then** it MUST provide framework-specific best practices and folder organization
4. **Given** multiple AI coding platforms, **When** I use Spec-Kit commands, **Then** they MUST work consistently across all platforms using native patterns
5. **Given** complex features with dependencies, **When** I plan implementation, **Then** it MUST guide SDK integration and dependency management effectively

### Edge Cases
- What happens when encountering a legacy project with no clear architecture?
- How does system handle migration between different AI platforms?
- What are the implications for projects with mixed architecture patterns?
- How does the feature handle incomplete or corrupted artifact metadata?
- What happens when agent transitions fail between documents?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-29
- Q: Project Types and Classification ‚Üí A: Multi-cycle agent analysis: List all files/dirs/artifacts, compare/contrast, use MCP validation, iterative self-evaluation to determine project status (greenfield/brownfield/ongoing/prototype)
- Q: Architecture Detection Methodology ‚Üí A: Full iterative assessment with multi-cycle domain-specific agents: frameworks, tech stack, patterns, data flow, API patterns, database schemas, anti-patterns, technical debt, architectural smells with cross-domain relational diagrams
- Q: Cross-Platform Compatibility Scope ‚Üí A: Tier 1 (Claude Code, Roo Code): Full integration with agents, hooks, MCP servers, automated workflows; Tier 2 (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.): Core features with manual setup; Tier 3 (Auggie CLI, etc.): Basic command support
