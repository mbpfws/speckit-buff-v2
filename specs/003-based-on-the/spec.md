# Feature Specification: Spec-Kit Realignment Fork - Back to Basics

**Feature Branch**: `003-based-on-the`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: ": Based on the analysis report showing spec-kit has drifted from its original vision of being a simple template and script system for AI agents, create a fork that realigns with the original principles while incorporating the improvements from specs/001-improve-spec-kit/spec.md but simplified according to the original minimalist philosophy. The fork should focus on: 1) Simple CLI with only init and check commands, 2) High-quality markdown templates instead of complex analysis, 3) Cross-platform shell scripts for automation, 4) Agent-first design where AI agents do the work, 5) Template-driven guardrails instead of complex governance. Transform the 001-improve-spec-kit requirements to fit this simplicity mindset while preserving valuable improvements."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ SUCCESS: Realignment fork requirements identified with simplicity focus
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: simplicity, realignment, template-driven, agent-first, minimal CLI
3. Validate against constitution principles:
   ’ Cross-Platform: Requirements apply to all 10 platforms 
   ’ Multi-Installation: Must support both installation methods 
   ’ Template-Driven: Core of the simplified approach 
   ’ Agent-Native: AI agents remain primary actors 
4. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
5. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ SUCCESS: Clear user scenarios for simplified workflow
   ’ Include cross-platform validation scenarios
6. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable across all platforms
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
   ’ Validate against template-driven consistency
7. Identify Key Entities (data involved)
   ’ Identified: Template System, CLI Tool, Script Library
8. Run Review Checklist
   ’ SUCCESS: All constitution principles addressed
   ’ Requirements aligned with simplicity goals
9. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### Cross-Platform Validation
- All requirements MUST work across all 10 supported platforms
- Requirements MUST NOT specify platform-specific implementation details
- User scenarios MUST account for different agent execution patterns
- Acceptance criteria MUST be verifiable on all platforms

### Template-Driven Consistency
- Specifications MUST follow established template structure
- Requirements MUST use standardized phrasing and formatting
- All specifications MUST be consumable by all AI agents
- Changes MUST propagate to dependent artifacts automatically

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Consider cross-platform implications**: Ensure requirements work on all 10 AI coding platforms
5. **Validate template consistency**: Follow established patterns and structure
6. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Cross-platform compatibility requirements
   - Multi-installation support considerations

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer who believes in the original vision of spec-kit, I want a fork that returns to the simple, elegant concept of using templates and scripts to guide AI agents, so that I can efficiently develop projects with minimal tooling overhead and maximum AI agent autonomy.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new project, **When** I run the simplified CLI init command, **Then** it MUST download templates and set up structure within 3 seconds without complex analysis
2. **Given** the template-based system, **When** I use /specify command with any AI agent, **Then** it MUST execute natively using only the template and script context
3. **Given** cross-platform needs, **When** I use any of the 10 supported AI platforms, **Then** all commands MUST work consistently without platform-specific modifications
4. **Given** existing improvements from 001-improve-spec-kit, **When** I use the fork, **Then** valuable improvements MUST be preserved but implemented through templates rather than complex code
5. **Given** the simplicity focus, **When** I examine the CLI code, **Then** it MUST be under 300 lines with only init and check commands

### Edge Cases
- What happens when templates need updating?
- How does the system handle custom template modifications?
- What are the implications for offline usage?
- How does the fork handle version compatibility with original spec-kit projects?
- What happens when AI agents need additional context beyond templates?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Simplified CLI Architecture
- **FR-001**: CLI MUST provide only two commands: init (downloads templates, sets up project) and check (verifies tools)
- **FR-002**: CLI MUST be under 300 lines of Python code with zero analysis or MCP integration features
- **FR-003**: CLI MUST download templates from GitHub releases without processing or analysis
- **FR-004**: CLI MUST support both persistent installation (uv tool) and one-time usage (uvx) patterns
- **FR-005**: CLI MUST have zero dependencies beyond Python standard library and requests for downloads

#### Template-Driven System
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide high-quality markdown templates for spec, plan, tasks, and constitution
- **FR-007**: Templates MUST include embedded guidance and examples instead of external analysis engines
- **FR-008**: Templates MUST be self-contained and executable by AI agents without additional tooling
- **FR-009**: Template system MUST support custom modifications while maintaining core structure
- **FR-010**: Templates MUST include cross-platform shell scripts for automation tasks

#### Agent-First Design
- **FR-011**: All commands (/specify, /plan, /tasks, /implement) MUST execute natively on all 10 AI platforms
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide platform-specific instruction files (.claude/, .roo/, etc.) generated from templates
- **FR-013**: AI agents MUST remain the primary actors for all analysis, planning, and implementation work
- **FR-014**: Templates MUST provide context and guardrails rather than enforcing rules through code
- **FR-015**: System MUST leverage AI agents' native capabilities instead of replacing them

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **FR-016**: All templates MUST work identically across all 10 supported AI coding platforms
- **FR-017**: Shell scripts MUST be provided in both bash and PowerShell for Windows compatibility
- **FR-018**: Template structure MUST be consumable by all AI agents without platform-specific modifications
- **FR-019**: System MUST handle platform-specific differences through templates, not code logic
- **FR-020**: All functionality MUST be accessible through slash commands on every platform

#### Simplified Improvements (from 001-improve-spec-kit)

- **FR-026**: System MUST support brownfield projects through template guidance, not complex analysis

- **FR-028**: All improvements MUST be implemented through template content, not code features

#### Governance and Maintenance
- **FR-029**: Constitution MUST be a simple guiding principles document, not complex governance system
- **FR-030**: Template updates MUST be handled through GitHub releases, not automated upgrade systems
- **FR-031**: System MUST trust users to follow templates rather than enforcing compliance
- **FR-032**: All MUST statements in templates MUST be framed as guidance, not requirements
