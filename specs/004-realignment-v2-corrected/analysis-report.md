---

## 1. Duplication Detection ✅

**Status**: PASS - No significant duplications detected

### Findings
- None

**Evaluation**: Requirements are distinct, tasks are uniquely identified, no redundant specifications.

---

## 2. Ambiguity Detection

**Status**: PASS with 2 LOW severity items

### Finding A-001: Vague Adjective "High/Med/Low" Confidence Levels [LOW]

**Location**: spec.md FR-023  
**Issue**: "Agents MUST report findings with confidence levels (High/Med/Low)"  
**Problem**: No measurable criteria for confidence level assignment  
**Impact**: LOW - Standard terminology, agents can use reasonable judgment  
**Recommendation**: Accept as-is or add guidance in brownfield-analysis.md template

### Finding A-002: Performance Target Context [LOW]

**Location**: spec.md NFR-001-004  
**Issue**: Performance targets lack test environment specification (cold start vs warm, hardware specs)  
**Problem**: "<3 seconds" and "<1 second" unclear if includes network time, disk I/O variance  
**Impact**: LOW - Reasonable targets for local operations, can be refined in testing  
**Recommendation**: Document test environment in performance benchmark task (T059)

---

## 3. Underspecification Analysis

**Status**: CAUTION with 2 MEDIUM severity items

### Finding U-001: Script LOC Estimates Unvalidated [MEDIUM]

**Location**: tasks.md T030-T043  
**Issue**: Each script has estimated LOC (e.g., "~50 LOC", "~80 LOC") totaling ~840 LOC across 14 scripts  
**Problem**: No validation that script LOC fits within reasonable maintainability bounds  
**Context**: CLI has 224/400 LOC budget, but scripts have no explicit limit  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Scripts could become unmaintainable if complex  
**Recommendation**: 
  - Add script complexity guideline (suggested: each script <150 LOC)
  - Document in plan.md or tasks.md
  - Consider refactoring if scripts exceed limits during implementation

### Finding U-002: Template Update Checksums Not Specified [MEDIUM]

**Location**: spec.md NFR-014  
**Issue**: "Template downloads MUST verify checksums (future)"  
**Problem**: Marked as "future" but no task or timeline for implementation  
**Context**: Security requirement deferred without plan  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Security concern, but offline mode mitigates risk  
**Recommendation**: 
  - Either remove "(future)" and create task for v2.0
  - Or document as v2.1+ feature in spec.md
  - Current mitigation: Templates from trusted GitHub Releases

---

## 4. Constitution Alignment Analysis ✅

**Status**: PASS - All principles satisfied

### Principle 1: Cross-Platform Compatibility ✅
- **Spec**: FR-016-020 (10 platforms, bash + PowerShell, identical output)
- **Plan**: Tech stack supports all platforms
- **Tasks**: T030-T043 create cross-platform scripts, T044 validates parity
- **Assessment**: PASS

### Principle 2: Multi-Installation Support ✅
- **Spec**: FR-003 (uv tool + uvx)
- **Plan**: Templates copied to .specify/ (independent of install method)
- **Tasks**: No special installation-specific tasks needed
- **Assessment**: PASS

### Principle 3: Template-Driven Consistency ✅
- **Spec**: FR-006-010 (7 templates, agent guidance)
- **Plan**: Templates as core system
- **Tasks**: T024-T029 created all templates (complete)
- **Assessment**: PASS

### Principle 4: Agent-Native Execution ✅
- **Spec**: FR-011-015 (workflows are markdown, not CLI commands)
- **Plan**: Clarification Q2 confirms agents read workflows
- **Tasks**: No workflow CLI tasks (preserves agent-native model)
- **Assessment**: PASS

### Principle 5: Simplicity Principle ✅
- **Spec**: FR-001-002 (<400 LOC, 2 commands, 4 deps)
- **Plan**: 224 LOC (56% of budget), zero engines
- **Tasks**: T022-T023 implement init+check, T056 validates LOC count
- **Assessment**: PASS

### Principle 6: Governance Balance ✅
- **Spec**: FR-038 (exit 0), FR-047 (user decides)
- **Plan**: Non-blocking validation emphasized
- **Tasks**: T030-T032 specify exit code 0
- **Assessment**: PASS

## 5. Coverage Gap Analysis

**Status**: CAUTION with 1 HIGH severity item

### Finding C-001: Missing Task for Workflow Command Files [HIGH]

**Location**: spec.md FR-011-015, plan.md Phase 1  
**Issue**: Spec requires workflow definitions in `templates/commands/*.md` but no tasks create them  
**Requirements**:
  - FR-011: Workflow definitions in templates/commands/
  - FR-012: Workflows reference .specify/templates/
  - FR-013: /plan loads .specify/memory/constitution.md
  - FR-014: /tasks uses .specify/templates/tasks-template.md
  - FR-015: /analyze validates against constitution

**Current Status**: Workflow files exist in repo (plan.md, specify.md, tasks.md, etc.) but not in tasks.md  
**Gap**: No task documents creation/verification of 7 workflow command files  
**Impact**: HIGH - Critical feature requirement not explicitly covered in task breakdown  
**Recommendation**: 
  - **Option A**: Document that workflows already exist (completed outside of 004)
  - **Option B**: Add task "T063: Verify workflow command files (7 files in templates/commands/)"
  - **Option C**: Add to Phase 3.4 retrospectively if they're actually complete

**Evidence Check**: Let me verify workflow files exist...
- Expected: specify.md, clarify.md, plan.md, tasks.md, analyze.md, implement.md, constitution.md
- Located in: `templates/commands/` directory

### Finding C-002: Quality Tool Detection Not Implemented [MEDIUM]

**Location**: spec.md FR-042-044  
**Issue**: Requirements for quality tool detection (FR-042: detect project type, FR-043: check for standard tools, FR-044: run available tools)  
**Tasks Coverage**: No specific tasks for quality tool detection logic  
**Context**: `specify check --quality` mentioned in FR-044 and check.py has --quality flag  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Feature specified but implementation not tasked  
**Recommendation**: 
  - Add task for quality tool detection (T063: Implement quality tool detection in check.py)
  - Or document as "agent-driven" (agents detect tools, CLI just reports)
  - Or defer to v2.1 and update spec

### Finding C-003: NFR-009 Cyclomatic Complexity Not Verified [MEDIUM]

**Location**: spec.md NFR-009  
**Issue**: "CLI code MUST have <10 cyclomatic complexity per function"  
**Tasks Coverage**: No task validates cyclomatic complexity  
**Context**: T056 validates LOC count but not complexity  
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Code quality requirement not enforced  
**Recommendation**: Add to T056 or create separate task with radon/mccabe tool

---

## 6. Inconsistency Detection

**Status**: PASS with 1 MEDIUM severity item

### Finding I-001: Task Count Mismatch [MEDIUM]

**Location**: tasks.md Summary vs Phase breakdown  
**Issue**: Summary says "Total: 50 tasks" but phases show T001-T062 (62 tasks)  
**Breakdown**:
  - Summary: "Total Tasks: 50, Completed: T001-T029 (29), Remaining: T030-T050 (21)"
  - Phase 3.5: T030-T047 (18 tasks)
  - Phase 3.6: T048-T054 (7 tasks) 
  - Phase 3.7: T055-T062 (8 tasks)
  - **Actual Total**: 29 + 18 + 7 + 8 = 62 tasks

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Documentation inconsistency, causes confusion  
**Recommendation**: Update tasks.md Summary to reflect actual count (62 tasks, 33 remaining)

### Finding I-002: Template Count Terminology [LOW]

**Location**: Multiple locations  
**Issue**: Spec says "7 templates" but lists 8 items in some places  
**Spec FR-008**: "7 templates: spec, plan, tasks, constitution, brownfield-analysis, architecture-patterns, agent-file"  
**Count**: That's actually 7 ✓  
**Plan summary**: Also says 7 templates  
**Tasks T024-T029**: Shows 6 tasks for template creation  
**Resolution**: Constitution counted separately (in memory/ not templates/), agent-file not yet created  
**Impact**: LOW - Minor documentation clarity issue  
**Recommendation**: Clarify that agent-file (WINDSURF.md, etc.) is generated by workflows, not a static template
