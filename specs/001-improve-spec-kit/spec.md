## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### Cross-Platform Validation
- All requirements MUST work across all 10 supported platforms
- Requirements MUST NOT specify platform-specific implementation details
- User scenarios MUST account for different agent execution patterns
- Acceptance criteria MUST be verifiable on all platforms

### Template-Driven Consistency
- Specifications MUST follow established template structure
- Requirements MUST use standardized phrasing and formatting
- All specifications MUST be consumable by all AI agents
- Changes MUST propagate to dependent artifacts automatically

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Consider cross-platform implications**: Ensure requirements work on all 10 AI coding platforms
5. **Validate template consistency**: Follow established patterns and structure
6. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs
   - Cross-platform compatibility requirements
   - Multi-installation support considerations
   - Architecture granularity requirements
   - Agent self-regulation capabilities

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team using Spec-Kit across multiple AI coding platforms, I need the framework to address its current shortcomings so that I can efficiently develop both greenfield and brownfield projects with proper architecture guidance, cross-platform compatibility, and reliable artifact management.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a brownfield project with existing codebase, **When** I initiate Spec-Kit analysis, **Then** it MUST detect project type, architecture, and historical context accurately
2. **Given** a feature development task, **When** I generate tasks, **Then** they MUST align with the actual codebase structure and maintain proper synchronization
3. **Given** cross-architecture requirements, **When** I create an implementation plan, **Then** it MUST provide framework-specific best practices and folder organization
4. **Given** multiple AI coding platforms, **When** I use Spec-Kit commands, **Then** they MUST work consistently across all platforms using native patterns
5. **Given** complex features with dependencies, **When** I plan implementation, **Then** it MUST guide SDK integration and dependency management effectively

### Edge Cases
- What happens when encountering a legacy project with no clear architecture?
- How does system handle migration between different AI platforms?
- What are the implications for projects with mixed architecture patterns?
- How does the feature handle incomplete or corrupted artifact metadata?
- What happens when agent transitions fail between documents?

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-29
- Q: Project Types and Classification ‚Üí A: Multi-cycle agent analysis: List all files/dirs/artifacts, compare/contrast, use MCP validation, iterative self-evaluation to determine project status (greenfield/brownfield/ongoing/prototype)
- Q: Architecture Detection Methodology ‚Üí A: Full iterative assessment with multi-cycle domain-specific agents: frameworks, tech stack, patterns, data flow, API patterns, database schemas, anti-patterns, technical debt, architectural smells with cross-domain relational diagrams
- Q: Cross-Platform Compatibility Scope ‚Üí A: Tier 1 (Claude Code, Roo Code): Full integration with agents, hooks, MCP servers, automated workflows; Tier 2 (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.): Core features with manual setup; Tier 3 (Auggie CLI, etc.): Basic command support

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: How should Spec-Kit handle conflicting architectural patterns in brownfield projects? ‚Üí A: User choice with hybrid analysis - agents investigate and show deep analysis of pros/cons for different routes, adapting to development schools/styles
- Q: What level of automation should Spec-Kit have for enforcing governance rules? ‚Üí A: Configurable per project with options to opt-out and modify. Warn messages offer choices: block/ignore for this turn, block and reroute with solutions, or complete ignore for this type of non-compliance
- Q: What level of architectural detail should artifacts include for different project complexities? ‚Üí A: Multi-tiered with iterative self-evaluation and HITL feedback loops. Includes measurement scales for planning stages, validated against real-world practical uses. During development, artifacts have automatic hooks as navigation, guardrails, and validation baselines for coding agents
- Q: How should Spec-Kit validate the quality and correctness of generated artifacts? ‚Üí A: Continuous integration through actual project usage plus user-driven validation. Highly iterative with hierarchical orders and file naming enforcers with IDs. Multi-agents auto-detect document relationships in tree-like organized structures (specs/feature-branch/docs/**/*.*) to prevent trashing and overlapping
- Q: How should Spec-Kit handle evolution of templates and best practices over time? ‚Üí A: Artifacts are reference documents (MD, YAML, XML, JSON) that agents base on for values, parameters, naming, relationships, data schemas, and API contracts. They grow, adapt, or are recreated as development slices appear or complexity increases, depending on project, stage, and development cycles
- Q: What specific compliance frameworks or regulatory requirements should Spec-Kit support? ‚Üí A: No specific compliance frameworks - only project-level governance
- Q: How should Spec-Kit handle version conflicts when multiple developers work on the same artifacts across different AI platforms? ‚Üí A: Single user per project with AI agent teams managed through git's branching, commits, pull requests, and review guardrails
- Q: What level of backward compatibility should Spec-Kit maintain with existing Spec-Kit projects and artifacts? ‚Üí A: Full backward compatibility - all existing projects work without changes
- Q: How should Spec-Kit handle proprietary or confidential code in brownfield projects during analysis? ‚Üí A: Trust-based system - assumes user manages their own data security
