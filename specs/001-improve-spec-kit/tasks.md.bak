# Tasks: Spec-Kit Enhancement Initiative

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-improve-spec-kit/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → SUCCESS: Implementation plan loaded from specs/001-improve-spec-kit/plan.md
   → Extract: Framework enhancement project, Python 3.11+, MCP servers, 10 AI coding platforms
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract 4 core entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: 4 API contracts → contract test tasks
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: Extract validation scenarios → test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: framework extension, MCP integration, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests, cross-platform tests
   → Core: analyzers, architecture engines, governance, agent workflows
   → Integration: MCP servers, platform-specific adaptations
   → Polish: performance, documentation, validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- Follow constitutional principles for all implementations
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Spec-Kit projects
