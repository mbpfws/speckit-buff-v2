## Validation Commands

### Installation Method Testing
```bash
# Test PATH installation compatibility
specify validate --installation path --platforms all

# Test uvx installation compatibility
specify validate --installation uvx --platforms all

# Comprehensive installation validation
specify validate --installation both --platforms all --detailed
```

### Platform-Specific Feature Validation
```bash
# Validate Tier 1 platform features
specify validate --tier 1 --features all --installation both

# Validate Tier 2 platform features
specify validate --tier 2 --features core --installation both

# Validate Tier 3 platform features
specify validate --tier 3 --features basic --installation both
```
