## Entity Relationships

### Primary Relationships
```
Project Analyzer → Architecture Engine
    ↓
Governance System ← Agent Workflow Manager
```

### Data Flow
1. **Project Analysis** → Architecture Detection → Governance Configuration
2. **Architecture Patterns** → Implementation Guidance → Task Generation
3. **Governance Rules** → Artifact Management → Cross-Platform Sync
4. **Agent Workflow** → Context Management → Performance Optimization

## Validation Rules

### Project Analyzer Validation
- **FR-001**: Must accurately classify project type with >90% accuracy
- **FR-002**: Must detect architectural patterns from existing codebase
- **FR-003**: Must map dependencies with complete dependency tree

### Architecture Engine Validation
- **FR-006**: Must provide framework-specific patterns for all detected frameworks
- **FR-007**: Must enforce domain-driven folder organization
- **FR-008**: Must promote modular, class-based code structuring

### Governance System Validation
- **FR-016**: Must enforce naming conventions consistently
- **FR-017**: Must synchronize AGENTS.md effectively
- **FR-019**: Must implement relational IDs for artifact relationships

### Agent Workflow Manager Validation
- **FR-022**: Must support agent self-correction and validation
- **FR-023**: Must provide context window management
- **FR-024**: Must include auto-prompt enhancement features

## State Transitions

### Project Analysis State Machine
```
Start → Initial Scan → Pattern Detection → Classification → Context Analysis → Complete
    ↓
Uncertain → Additional Analysis → Reclassification → Complete
```

### Architecture Guidance State Machine
```
Project Type → Framework Detection → Pattern Selection → Guidance Generation → Implementation Ready
```

### Governance Enforcement State Machine
```
Artifact Creation → Metadata Assignment → Relationship Mapping → Validation → Synchronization
```

## Cross-Platform Considerations

### Platform-Specific Attributes
- **Tier 1 Platforms**: Full attribute support with automation
- **Tier 2 Platforms**: Core attributes with manual configuration
- **Tier 3 Platforms**: Basic attribute support

### Data Persistence
- **Artifact Metadata**: Stored in hierarchical file structure
- **Relationship IDs**: Maintained in cross-referenced documents
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracked for optimization

## Integration Points

### External Dependencies
- **AI Coding Platforms**: 10 supported platforms with native integration
- **File System**: Hierarchical artifact organization
- **Version Control**: Git integration for synchronization

### Internal Dependencies
- **Constitution**: Governance rule enforcement
- **Templates**: Consistent artifact generation
- **Scripts**: Cross-platform automation

## Data Evolution

### Versioning Strategy
- **Major Version**: Breaking changes to entity relationships
- **Minor Version**: New attributes or validation rules
- **Patch Version**: Bug fixes and optimizations

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing Spec-Kit projects must work without changes
- New attributes optional for existing implementations
- Deprecated attributes maintained for compatibility
