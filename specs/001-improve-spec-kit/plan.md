# Implementation Plan: Spec-Kit Enhancement Initiative

**Branch**: `001-improve-spec-kit` | **Date**: 2025-09-29 | **Spec**: [specs/001-improve-spec-kit/spec.md](specs/001-improve-spec-kit/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-improve-spec-kit/spec.md`
**Technical Context**: User description: "I sugeest that you take a look at all documents and artifacts generated from this again iteratively with multi sub-agents
and mcp servers' tools (use context7, DeepWiki, Tavily Search tool, internet browser) must be used, as this is extremely surface and as you have not investigate this
 codebase for the original github spec-kit of how it works, multiple aspects, sectors of
@templates\commands\ @templates\ of the project's @src\specify_cli\ and their @scripts\ .  You must be very clear of this
project, that you are building using the spec-kit framework (the original one) and this happens (also)
 to be the fork of that mentioned spec-kit. And also the way you documenting docs and artifacts show
misunderstanding, this is in no way related to the official github spec-kit and its team."

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This implementation plan addresses comprehensive improvements to the Spec-Kit framework, focusing on enhancing brownfield project support, cross-architecture guidance, artifact management, governance systems, and agent capabilities. The initiative builds upon the original Spec-Kit architecture while extending its capabilities to address current shortcomings in project analysis, architectural detection, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (CLI), Cross-platform support for all AI agents
**Primary Dependencies**: Typer, Rich, httpx, MCP servers (Tavily, Context7, DeepWiki, Fetch)
**Storage**: File-based artifacts, Git-backed version control
**Testing**: pytest, bash/PowerShell script validation, cross-platform agent testing
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) with 10 AI coding platforms
**Project Type**: Enhancement framework for existing Spec-Kit installation
**Performance Goals**: Sub-second response for analysis, minimal overhead on existing workflows
**Constraints**: Must maintain full backward compatibility, cannot break existing projects
**Scale/Scope**: Framework-level enhancements affecting all Spec-Kit projects

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Structure Decision**: Enhancement of existing Spec-Kit structure with new capabilities
- Core CLI enhancements in `src/specify_cli/`
- New analysis engines and templates
- Extended script automation in `scripts/bash/` and `scripts/powershell/`
- Enhanced template system in `.specify/templates/`
- Artifact management improvements

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - MCP server integration patterns for deep analysis
   - Multi-agent orchestration methodologies
   - Brownfield project analysis algorithms
   - Cross-architecture detection patterns
   - Artifact synchronization mechanisms
   - Governance enforcement strategies

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Research advanced project analysis techniques using MCP servers
   - Investigate architectural pattern recognition across frameworks
   - Study artifact management best practices
   - Analyze governance enforcement mechanisms
   - Research cross-platform agent synchronization

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [chosen approach]
   - Rationale: [technical justification]
   - Alternatives considered: [evaluated options]
   - Implementation complexity: [assessment]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Project Analyzer entity with analysis capabilities
   - Architecture Engine with framework patterns
   - Governance System with enforcement rules
   - Agent Workflow Manager with orchestration logic
   - Artifact relationships and metadata schemas

2. **Generate system contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Project analysis API contracts
   - Architecture detection service contracts
   - Artifact management contracts
   - Governance enforcement contracts
   - Agent orchestration contracts
   - Output to `/contracts/` as OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Test project classification accuracy
   - Validate architectural pattern detection
   - Verify artifact synchronization
   - Test governance enforcement
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract validation scenarios** from user stories:
   - Brownfield project analysis workflow
   - Cross-platform compatibility validation
   - Artifact synchronization scenarios
   - Governance enforcement scenarios
   - Quickstart validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Core framework enhancement tasks:
  - Project Analyzer implementation
  - Architecture Engine development
  - Governance System enhancement
  - Agent Workflow Manager creation
  - Template system improvements
  - Cross-platform compatibility validation
- Integration tasks for MCP servers
- Testing and validation tasks
- Documentation updates

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Foundation first: Core analysis engines before UI improvements
- TDD order: Contract tests before implementation
- Parallel execution where possible (marked [P])
- Integration points validated last

**Estimated Output**: 77-80 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md (expanded due to: MCP server integration complexity, 10-platform cross-platform validation, comprehensive testing requirements, detailed documentation needs)

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation, cross-platform verification)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
