description: Create feature specification through iterative conversation with complexity analysis and research
auto_execution_mode: 3
---

**IMPORTANT**: This workflow is CONVERSATIONAL. Do NOT immediately create spec.md. Instead:
1. Analyze complexity
2. Present initial understanding
3. Ask clarifying questions
4. Do research if needed
5. Present findings and ask for feedback
6. THEN create spec with user approval

The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

**User's Feature Request**:

## Workflow Execution (Conversational Mode)

### Phase 1: Analyze & Understand

**Objective**: Understand the feature without making assumptions

1. **Analyze complexity** (attempt automatic, fallback to manual):
   ```bash
   # Try automatic detection (may fail - that's OK)
   echo "$ARGUMENTS" | .specify/scripts/bash/detect-complexity.sh 2>/dev/null
   
   # If script fails, analyze manually based on these indicators:
   # - Technology stack mentions (databases, APIs, frameworks)
   # - Integration requirements (third-party, payments, auth)
   # - Architecture needs (real-time, scalable, distributed)
   # - Complexity keywords (complex, enterprise, multi-tenant)
   ```

2. **Manual complexity scoring** (if script fails):
   - Count technology indicators ‚Üí multiply by 2
   - Count integration indicators ‚Üí multiply by 3
   - Count architecture indicators ‚Üí multiply by 4
   - Score ‚â•10 = HIGH, ‚â•5 = MEDIUM, ‚â•2 = LOW-MEDIUM, <2 = LOW

3. **Present your initial understanding** to the user:
   ```markdown
   üìä **Feature Understanding**
   
   I understand you want to build: [restate in your words]
   
   **Complexity Analysis**:
   - Level: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]
   - Technology areas detected: [list]
   - Integration points: [list if any]
   - Architecture concerns: [list if any]
   
   **My initial thoughts**:
   - [Key challenge 1]
   - [Key challenge 2]
   - [Open question 1]
   - [Open question 2]
   ```

4. **DO NOT PROCEED** until you've shown this understanding

### Phase 2: Research & Discovery (Conditional)

**IF complexity is MEDIUM or HIGH**, initiate research conversation:

1. **Inform the user**:
   ```markdown
   üîç **Research Needed**
   
   This is a complex feature spanning multiple domains. Before we finalize the spec,
   I'd like to research:
   
   1. [Research topic 1] - to find current best practices
   2. [Research topic 2] - to identify specific versions/SDKs
   3. [Research topic 3] - to understand architecture patterns
   
   This will take a few minutes but will result in a much more informed specification.
   
   **Proceed with research? [Y/n]**
   ```

2. **If user approves**, conduct research using web search:
   ```markdown
   üî¨ **Researching...**
   
   Pass 1: Technology Stack
   - Searching: "[technology] best practices 2025"
   - Searching: "[framework] latest stable version"
   ‚Üí Finding: [Key finding with URL]
   
   Pass 2: Integration Patterns
   - Searching: "[integration] SDK documentation"
   - Searching: "[service] API authentication"
   ‚Üí Finding: [Key finding with URL]
   
   Pass 3: Architecture
   - Searching: "[domain] architecture patterns"
   - Searching: "[use case] scalability case study"
   ‚Üí Finding: [Key finding with URL]
   ```

3. **Present research findings**:
   ```markdown
   ‚úÖ **Research Complete**
   
   **Technology Recommendations**:
   - [Tech 1]: [Specific version] - [Why/URL]
   - [Tech 2]: [Specific SDK] - [Why/URL]
   
   **Architecture Pattern**: [Pattern name]
   - Based on: [Case study/URL]
   - Benefits: [List]
   - Trade-offs: [List]
   
   **Integration Approach**: [Approach]
   - [Detail 1]
   - [Detail 2]
   
   **Questions before we finalize**:
   1. [Technical choice question]
   2. [Scale/performance question]
   3. [Integration preference question]
   ```

4. **Wait for user feedback** on research findings

### Phase 3: Clarifying Questions (Interactive)

**Before creating spec**, ask 3-5 targeted questions based on complexity:

**For ALL features, ask about**:
- **Scope**: What's the MVP vs future phases?
- **Users**: Who are the primary users?
- **Success criteria**: How do we measure success?

**Additional questions based on complexity**:

**If HIGH complexity**:
- How many concurrent users do you expect?
- What are the performance requirements (latency, throughput)?
- Any compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)?
- What's the scale/growth trajectory?

**If MEDIUM/HIGH with integrations**:
- Which third-party services are preferred?
- Any existing accounts/APIs we should use?
- Authentication method preferences?

**If MEDIUM/HIGH with real-time**:
- What's acceptable latency?
- Offline support needed?
- Conflict resolution strategy?

**Present questions conversationally**:
```markdown
ü§î **A few questions to help me create the best spec**:

1. [Question 1 based on above]
2. [Question 2 based on above]
3. [Question 3 based on above]
4. [Question 4 if needed]
5. [Question 5 if needed]

Feel free to answer what you know - we can refine during /clarify later!
```

**Wait for user responses**

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Preview

Before creating the final spec, synthesize everything:

```markdown
üìù **Specification Preview**

Based on our conversation, here's what I'll include in the spec:

**Feature**: [Title]
**Complexity**: [Level]
**Technology Stack** (researched):
- [Tech 1 with version]
- [Tech 2 with version]
- [Integration with details]

**Core Requirements**:
1. [Requirement from conversation]
2. [Requirement from research]
3. [Requirement from clarifications]

**Architecture**:
- Pattern: [Researched pattern]
- Rationale: [Why based on research]

**Open Questions** (for /clarify phase):
1. [Unresolved question 1]
2. [Unresolved question 2]

**Does this look good? I'll create the formal spec if you approve. [Y/n]**
```

**Wait for user approval**

### Phase 5: Create Feature Branch & Spec

**ONLY after user approval**, proceed:

1. Run the script `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse its JSON output for BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE. All file paths must be absolute.
   **IMPORTANT** You must only ever run this script once. The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for.

2. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.

3. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure:
   - Replace placeholders with concrete details from feature description
   - **If research was conducted**: Integrate research findings into:
     - Technical constraints section
     - Non-functional requirements
     - Technology recommendations (add new section if needed)
   - Preserve section order and headings
   - Mark ambiguities with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: question]`

4. Add complexity metadata to spec frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   complexity_level: <level>
   research_conducted: <boolean>
   multi_domain: <boolean>
   ```

5. **Create the spec file** at SPEC_FILE path

6. **If research was conducted**, create `research.md`:
   ```markdown
   # Research Findings: [Feature Title]
   
   **Date**: [Today]
   **Complexity Level**: [Level]
   **Research Passes**: [Number]
   
   ## Technology Stack Research
   
   ### [Technology 1]
   - **Version**: [Specific version]
   - **Why**: [Rationale]
   - **Source**: [URL]
   - **Notes**: [Key findings]
   
   ### [Technology 2]
   - **Version**: [Specific version]
   - **Why**: [Rationale]
   - **Source**: [URL]
   
   ## Integration Patterns
   
   ### [Integration 1]
   - **SDK**: [Specific SDK with version]
   - **Authentication**: [Method]
   - **Source**: [Official docs URL]
   - **Notes**: [Implementation notes]
   
   ## Architecture Patterns
   
   ### Recommended Pattern: [Pattern Name]
   - **Description**: [What it is]
   - **Why**: [Rationale from research]
   - **Case Study**: [URL to production example]
   - **Trade-offs**:
     - ‚úÖ Benefits: [List]
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations: [List]
   
   ## Summary
   
   **Technology recommendations**:
   - [Summary list with versions]
   
   **Key architectural decisions**:
   1. [Decision with rationale]
   2. [Decision with rationale]
   ```

### Phase 6: Update Context & Report

1. **Save context** to `.specify/context.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "complexity_level": "<level>",
     "complexity_score": <number>,
     "multi_domain": <boolean>,
     "research_complete": <boolean>,
     "research_passes_completed": <number>,
     "technology_recommendations": {
       "stack": ["<tech with version>"],
       "integrations": ["<service with SDK>"]
     },
     "spec_created": true,
     "clarifications_from_specify": <number>,
     "feature_id": "<id>"
   }
   ```

2. **Report completion** with detailed summary:
   ```markdown
   ‚úÖ **Specification Created Successfully**
   
   üìÑ **Location**: `specs/[feature-id]/spec.md`
   
   üìä **Details**:
   - **Complexity**: [Level] (score: [N])
   - **Research**: [Yes/No] ([N] passes, [M] sources)
   - **Technology stack**: [Tech1 vX.Y, Tech2 vA.B]
   - **Clarifications resolved**: [N]
   - **Open questions**: [N] (for /clarify)
   
   üî¨ **Research Highlights** (if applicable):
   - [Key finding 1]
   - [Key finding 2]
   - [Key architectural decision]
   
   üìã **Next Steps**:
   1. **Review spec**: `cat specs/[feature-id]/spec.md`
   2. **Review research**: `cat specs/[feature-id]/research.md` (if exists)
   3. **Clarify ambiguities**: Run `/clarify` to address open questions
   4. **Create plan**: Run `/plan` for implementation approach
   
   üìÇ **Files Created**:
   - ‚úÖ spec.md (main specification)
   - ‚úÖ research.md (research findings) [if applicable]
   - ‚úÖ .specify/context.json (workflow state)
   ```

## Agent Guidelines

1. **Be conversational**: This is a dialogue, not a form-filling exercise
2. **Show your work**: Present analysis before decisions
3. **Ask before acting**: Get user approval before creating files
4. **Research when needed**: Use web search for complex features
5. **Cite sources**: Always include URLs from research
6. **Iterate**: Refine understanding through questions
7. **Be specific**: Avoid vague recommendations ("use Express" ‚Üí "Express v4.19.2")
8. **Track context**: Save state for downstream workflowsducted
